    "\n",
    "To better prepare you for future endeavors in these areas, we want to give you exposure to real world applications of the material via Python (specifically, the Python scientific computing stack of numpy, scipy, and matplotlib all together in iPython notebooks), a popular tool in both industry and academia.\n",
    "\n",
    "The labs showcase algorithms and topics that are typically not directly covered in lecture, but that are fully comprehensible using the knowledge you've gained from class. Typically, we provide a \"Background\" section (and/or information within the actual questions) at the start of the lab explaining the topic in sufficient detail for you to complete the lab. In addition, there will typically be a \"References\" section at the end containing relevant links for exploring the topic further, as well as links we used in developing the labs, although these aren't required reading by any means.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, the format of any given lab will be:\n",
    "- Background\n",
    "- Questions\n",
    "- References\n",

    "Occasionally, questions will be marked as optional, in which case the question is not graded. Doing them will *not* earn you extra credit; they just serve as extra practice and examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have invested much time and effort into making these labs interesting and application-driven, and hope that you find them both informative and fun. We welcome and encourage any feedback you have on them - it's an invaluable source of data for us. We'll be releasing Google Forms after each submission deadline where you can provide us with anonymous feedback."

Scipy, on the other hand, is more of a collection of various useful functions that you'll look up when you need to do something really specific that numpy doesn't have, like digital filter design (see EE 123 for more) or some more complicated algorithms like k-means clustering (as you saw in EE 16B)."

    "\n",
    "In EE 120, we will consider two types of signals:\n",
    "- Discrete Time (DT) signals, which are functions from the integers ($\\{..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...\\}$) to the real (or complex) numbers.\n",
    "- Continuous Time (CT) signals, which are functions from the real numbers to the real (or complex) numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a mathematical point of view, considering signals as functions is incredibly useful. It enables us to do all sorts of operations on them that you're already familar with, such as multiplying them by each other or taking linear combinations of them. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreting time indices\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when working on a computer, there is a key limitation we must cope with: **finite memory**. We can't store a signal's value for every integer (in the DT case) or every real number (in the CT case). Instead, we represent signals as discrete arrays of some fixed length $N$. As a result, there are understood conventions in signals and systems for how to interpret the time indices associated with a signal's array representation:\n",
    "- In DT, the first value is considered to be $n=0$, and the last to be $n=N-1$, for a total of $N$ values. Since the first value you have is the start of the signal, it makes to call it time \"zero\". This is convenient, as it's the same as the array indexing convention in (most) programming languages: the first value has index 0, and the last has index in a length $N$ array is $N-1$. Outside of these $N$ values, the signal is assumed to be implicitly zero. \n",
    "- In CT, signals are first *sampled* before they go onto a computer for processing, a method we'll discuss in more detail later in the semester. Again, the first sample is considered as time zero as in the DT case, but based on the *sampling rate*, we can assign a time in seconds to each sample. For example, digital audio is typically obtained by sampling acoustic pressure on a microphone (a CT signal) at 44.1 kHz, or 44100 times a second. This means that each sample is separated by 1/44100 seconds, so our samples correspond to $t=0$ seconds (the 1st sample), $t=1/44100$ seconds (the 2nd sample), $t=2/44100$ seconds (the 3rd sample), and so on, until $t=(N-1)/44100$ seconds when the last sample is taken for $N$ total samples. Again, outside of these $N$ samples, the signal is assumed to be zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "In real world signal processing tasks, you're typically given information about where your signal came from, including whether or not it's truly DT or a sampled version of a CT signal, and if so, what the sampling rate was. In this lab, we'll only consider DT signals, with associated time indices given to you. Sometimes, you'll be asked to include some of the implicit zeros as you gain comfort with these conventions."

Just as calling the \"int\" function causes Python to cast floating-point numbers to integers by chopping off, or *truncating*, the decimal part of the number (e.g. `int(3.1415) = 3`, so that `.1415` is removed), we can ignore all the signal values past some point by not including them. For example, in the above plots, we truncate the signals at $n=20$, so there are only 21 nonzero points in the output. The reason this is well-justified is that for most rates that aren't too small, exponentials decay very rapidly. In the first two plots above, for $n=20$, the signal value appears to have already decayed to zero anyways! For the third, we'd simply need to use more data points (likely around 50-100) if we wanted to capture all signal values above ~.001 or so."

    "**Q:** In general, the convolution of two rects of different lengths is a trapezoid, which you should see from your plots. We'll define the length of the trapezoid's top as the number of points for which it attains its maximum value. For example, the length of a triangle's top is 1, since it peaks at one data point and slopes downward on either side of the peak. \n",

We'll use length two rects here, although you'll get a similar result if you use a larger size, or even if you vary the size of rects you convolve (e.g., you convolve with a length 2, then a length 3, then a length 7, then a length 2 again, and so on), so long as the total number of convolutions performed is large.\n",

So, if we wanted to apply a large number of filters that all had rectangular impulse responses (such as in the case of a moving average filter, for example), we could equivalently apply a *Gaussian filter*, i.e. one with a Gaussian (bell curve) as its impulse response. The Gaussian filter shows up in a wide variety of signal processing contexts for smoothing, and as you've seen here, it's the limiting case of applying a large number of rectangular filters (i.e., moving averages)."

    "Believe it or not, it's no coincidence that we got a Gaussian-like signal by convolving a large number of rects. This is actually a consequence of one of the most celebrated results in probability theory, the [Central Limit Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem). This theorem says that, under certain conditions, as you add together more and more random variables, the result approaches a Gaussian distribution, i.e. the familiar bell curve. An interesting fact covered in EECS 126 is that if you add two independent random variables, the resultant distribution is the **convolution** of the summands' distributions. Thus, by convolving 100 rects together, we are effectively adding together 100 independent uniform random variables (the probability mass function of a uniform r.v. is a rectangle, since each value is equally probable), and we see that the result has a Gaussian distribution!\n",

There are some interesting connections between signal processing and probability theory that will be mentioned from time to time in the labs for your enrichment, but you're not responsible for understanding any of their content."

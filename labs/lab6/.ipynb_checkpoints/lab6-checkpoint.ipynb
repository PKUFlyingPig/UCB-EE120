    "\n",
    "Most interesting systems in the physical world use feedback to regulate or stabilize themselves.\n",
    "For example, imagine you're building the steering system for a car.\n",
    "Most modern cars are drive-by-wire, meaning that instead of a direct mechanical link from the steering wheel to the front wheels, there's a computer driving a motor to perform steering.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an open-loop system, you would simply program the computer to have the wheel angle track the steering wheel and hope that the angles match.\n",
    "However, you might consider a closed-loop system instead where you use a sensor to measure the actual wheel angle, then drive the motor until it matches the reference angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The controller design is greatly simplified, since the process we are trying to control (called a plant) can be treated as a \"black-box\".\n",
    "* Open-loop systems tend to exhibit drift from their desired outputs over time due to modeling imperfections, disturbances, and noise.\n",
    "  Under a closed-loop system, the input compensates for errors as they occur.\n",
    "* Closed-loop control can correct for errors at much higher frequency than a human operator can."

    "\n",
    "* Here, we've presented control for simple single-input single-output (SISO) systems.\n",
    "  You can imagine extending this framework to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems to control multiple state variables at once (for example, controlling both $x$ and $\\theta$ in the demo above).\n",
    "* Tuning PID will often depend on the kind of transient and steady-state behavior you're trying to achieve (e.g. overshoot, rise time, etc).\n",
    "  EE 128 goes much deeper into how to perform this design, and how the frequency-based techniques you've learned in 120 relate to state-space-based techniques.\n",
    "* There are many extensions we can consider:\n",
    "    * Saturation: There are limits to what controls can be applied. For example, an op-amp that's applying a gain will saturate outside of its voltage rails. [Here](http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~murray/books/AM08/pdf/fbs-pid_01Jan19.pdf) are some ways to deal with saturation and integral windup.\n",
    "    * Sometimes, the control signal generated might involve switching an actuator on and off at a very high frequency, which might be undesirable because it can wear out a physical system.\n",
    "      Not surprisingly, the solution might involve lowpass-filtering the control signal.\n",
    "    * A control signal might incur considerable cost to apply, so we might want to model finding the control as an optimization problem.\n",
    "      Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) is one popular technique for operating a system optimally whose cost is quadratic in the states and inputs (some [notes](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee221a/fa19/lectures/Lecture11b_Somil.pdf) on the discrete-time case).\n",
